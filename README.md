### Hi there 🙋🏽‍♂️, I'm Francesco, nice to meet you!

My journey into the tech world began with a passion for science, leading me to apply to engineering school after high school. After earning a bachelor's and master's degree, and improving my English in San Diego, I started my career as an Embedded Software Engineer, where I discovered my love for coding. This sparked my decision to move to Barcelona, where I immersed myself in a new language and culture while attending Codeworks, an intense bootcamp that set the foundation for my career as a Full Stack Software Developer.

Now, with several years of experience, I specialize in designing and implementing cloud solutions on AWS. My focus is on creating resilient, scalable systems through serverless and event-driven architectures, delivering impactful business outcomes. I’m passionate about leveraging AWS services to build robust solutions that drive growth and performance.

I am always eager to learn and continuously push myself outside my comfort zone. This mindset allows me to expand my knowledge and overcome challenges. When faced with difficult tasks, I break them down into smaller, more manageable problems, gaining better perspective and making it easier to find solutions.

In my free time, I enjoy a wide range of sports, from beach volleyball 🏐 to snowboarding 🏂, and I also love playing the guitar 🎸.
