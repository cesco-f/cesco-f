### Hi there 🙋🏽‍♂️, I'm Francesco, nice to meet you!

After being an embedded software developer for more than 2 years I'm now a full stack developer, always eager to learn more and to get out of my comfort zone.
I love being surrounded by smart and talented people from which I always try to learn as much as possible.

When coding I always try to make my code as clean and efficient as possible. For me, code readability is of utmost importance.

Coming from programming in C, I would always prefer using TypeScript. In my opinion it makes the code more robust and less prone to errors.

In my free time I love practicing any kind of sport, from beach volley 🏐 to snowboarding 🏂 and playing the guitar 🎸.

If you have any questions feel free to contact me 📱
